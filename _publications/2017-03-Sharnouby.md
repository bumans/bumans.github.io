In this paper, we used chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) to examine features of Drosophila genome organization.  We focused especially on regions at the boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs) and identified chromatin modifications associated with these sites, which may support local-scale topological organization of the genome.
