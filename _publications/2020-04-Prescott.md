In this paper, we identified and characterized a defined subset of sensory neurons that detects chemical stimuli in the larynx to evoke protective reflexes.  Using single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse vagal ganglia and an optogenetic screen, we identified neurons that are necessary and sufficient for water- and acid-evoked airway protective reflexes.  We further identified a role for purinergic signaling from upstream laryngeal taste cells in detection of laryngeal water cues.
