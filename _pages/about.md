I am a postdoc with [Yoav Gilad](https://www.giladlab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago, using human stem cells to study how genetic variation interacts with environmental stress during brain development.  I completed my PhD with [Steve Liberles](https://liberles.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School, where I used mouse genetic tools to deconstruct cell type-specific sensory functions of the vagus nerve and became fascinated by the bidirectional communication between the body and the brain that drives physiology and perception.  Prior to my doctoral work, I studied applied statistics and genetics in the UK on a Marshall Scholarship.
